# PhoneNow Project
TASK 1: Customer Retention

The Retention Manager at PhoneNow wants to understand their customers data who likely to churn in advance.

A dashboard is created based on the inputs provided by the Manager.

TASK 2: Call Center Trends

Scenario: Call center Manager at PhoneNow is looking for transparency and insight into the data to get an accurate overview of long term trends in customers and agent behaviours.

A dashboard in Power BI for the Manager is created that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

TASK 3: Diversity Inclusion

A telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress.

Defined relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and created a visualisation.
